$ cd myapp && npm install run: npm start link: http://localhost:8000

I used ant design pro template for the project(type script, react 17, husky, eslint ...). You can login without username/password I only built the profile page because it already includes features that other pages have I built it with 90% of the design, the remaining 10% I think users will have a better experience with it The body record section gives users the option of day, week, month, and year and view the diary right here with a popup.

About the coding I develop in file src/pages/MyProfile/index.tsx src/components/Chart/index.tsx src/components/DiaryModal/index.tsx
